Turn it up loud hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the starrrrt
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts
So many questions
When this began we was the perfect match
Perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it
And now
The arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin
Out just a little wayJust take my hand and understand
If you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment
In other arms i wanna shelter you from harm
Don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause
You got me stressin soon as I open up the
Door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're
Killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave
It's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back
I'm a sucka for love
I'm never gonna dance again
Hahahaha thats right
Guilty feet have got no rhythm sucka for love
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool, a sucka for love
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
A sucka for love
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
